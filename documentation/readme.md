#Introduction
KISS is a lightweight inventory management system, specifically designed for grocery shopping.

This build consists of a web application which allows users to sign up for accounts, create lists, add items to the lists, while applying simple attributes to said items, and share these lists with other users.

KISS is built using PHP as it's main web technology, using several functions to complete different tasks. It also uses javascript and the Twitter Bootstrap library.

NOTE: This current version only implements Twitter Boostrap v2.3.2, plans to update to v3.0.2 are in place.
